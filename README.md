## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone <repo-git-url>
cd feedback-analyzer
```

### 2.Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Optional)

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up OpenAI API Key

Create a file named `.env` in the project root:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not commit this file. It‚Äôs already added to .gitignore.

### 5. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```

### üìÑ Input CSV Format

To use this app, upload a **CSV file** that contains a column with user feedback.

You can try it with the provided [example file](resources/sample_feedbacks.csv).

#### ‚úÖ Required Column

- `feedback` (case-insensitive)
  - This column should contain **free-text user comments** (e.g., complaints, suggestions, praise).
  - The app will normalize the column name internally, so `Feedback`, `FEEDBACK`, or `feedBack` are all accepted.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Validation Rules

- The CSV must be readable (standard comma-separated file).
- The file **must contain** a column named `"feedback"` (in any case).
- The feedback column **must not be completely empty**.
- CSVs missing the feedback column will trigger an error.

### 6. Run tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```
